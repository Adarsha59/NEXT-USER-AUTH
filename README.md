# User Authentication and Email Verification in Next.js

## Overview

This project implements user authentication features such as signup, email verification, login, and data retrieval using Next.js. It utilizes Mailtrap for email verification and Nodemailer for sending emails. The backend requests are tested using the Thunder Client extension in Visual Studio Code.

## Features

- **User Signup**: Allows users to create an account by providing their email.
- **Email Verification**: Sends a verification email to the user's email address using Mailtrap. Users must verify their email to activate their account.

- **User Login**: Authenticates users and manages sessions using cookies.

- **Retrieve User Data**: Provides a way to access the logged-in user's data.

- **Logout Functionality**: Allows users to log out and clear their session.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Next.js**: A React framework for building server-rendered applications.
- **Nodemailer**: A module for Node.js to send emails.

- **Mailtrap**: A tool for testing email sending in development. More information can be found at [Mailtrap](https://mailtrap.io/inboxes).

- **Thunder Client**: A lightweight API client for testing backend requests directly within Visual Studio Code.

## Learning Journey

As a beginner, I have learned how to:

1. Implement user authentication features in a web application.
2. Use Nodemailer for sending verification emails.
3. Test API endpoints using Thunder Client.
4. Manage user sessions with cookies.

This project serves as a foundational step in my journey to becoming proficient in web development with Next.js.
